                        Hi, I'm a software engineer from Kathmandu, Nepal. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University in 2023. Since then, I've worked for several startups on roles related to Web Development and Machine Learning.

                    <h2 className="mb-4">
                        I started out as an Applied Machine Learning Intern at a startup where I continued working as a full-time engineer from May 2023 to May 2024. My main interests lie in Web Development and Machine Learning. As a Web Developer, I mainly work with technologies such as ReactJS, Tailwindcss, FastAPI, Django, Opensearch, Amazon Web Services(AWS), Postgresql, Docker, Nginx etc. As a Machine Learning Engineer, I've worked with many Large Language Models such as GPTs, Claude, Gemini to build applications based on them and conduct experiments for their usability as Conversational Agents. I've also worked with Computer Vision and Image Generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion, Dall-E and built applications based on them.
